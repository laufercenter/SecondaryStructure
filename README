Distance matrices extracted from PDB.

Non-redundant PDB downloaded from Zhang.

Secondary structures computed using STRIDE in VMD.

Extracted upper and lower bounds based on 5th and 95th percentile.

Each file in results is for:
    - Either helix or extended
    - 4 to 20 continuous helical or extended residues
    - n x n x 2
    - last dimension is lower [:,:,0] or upper [:,:,1] bounds
